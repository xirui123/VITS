 #This code imports several modules from within the same package.
 #The first line imports all functions and classes from the module "generate_lexicon" using a relative import. 
 #The dot (".") in front of "generate_lexicon" indicates that it is located in the same package as the current module.
 #The second line imports all functions and classes from the module "normalizer" using a relative import.
 #The third line is commented out using the "#" character. It appears to be importing a module called "phonectic", 
 #but the line is commented out so it will not be executed.
 #The fourth line imports all functions and classes from the module "punctuation" using a relative import.
 #The fifth line imports all functions and classes from the module "tone_sandhi" using a relative import.
 #The sixth line imports all functions and classes from the module "vocab" using a relative import.
